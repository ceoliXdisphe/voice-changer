If you want to download Garmin friluftskarta for free, you have a few options. One of them is to use OpenStreetMap-Garmin maps[^1^], which are based on the free and open source OpenStreetMap data. You can download maps for individual countries or regions, or the whole European continent. You can also choose between different types of maps, such as topographic, truck or DEM (digital elevation model). The maps are updated weekly and can be used on your Garmin device or on your computer with BaseCamp software.
 
Another option is to use Frikart.no[^3^], which offers free maps for Garmin GPS devices based on data from various sources, such as OpenStreetMap, Kartverket and LantmÃ¤teriet. You can select a country from the map or the list and download the map file. The maps are updated regularly and include contour lines, hill shading and routable roads.
 
Whichever option you choose, you will need to copy the downloaded map file to your Garmin device or a microSD card. You can use BaseCamp software to transfer the map file to your device or manage your maps on your computer. You can also view the map in 2D or 3D, create and edit routes and waypoints, geotag photos and more.
